\chapter{Improvements}
\label{sec:impr}

This chapter is split into the 4 programming tasks we were given to improve the \emph{Chrysalis} system and is therefore the place where we present most of the work we've done.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:impr:enzian}:} Restructuring the System to make it easier to maintain and expand.
    \item \textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:impr:persistence}:} Adding a persistence layer that stores information outside the browser and the Blockchain.
    \item \textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:impr:hl}:} Creating an expansion to the system by implementing BPM on a \emph{Hyperledger} Blockchain.
    \item \textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:impr:eth}:} Improving the Smart Contract code that the \emph{Ethereum} application deploys and invokes to make it more efficient and easier to maintain.
\end{itemize}
