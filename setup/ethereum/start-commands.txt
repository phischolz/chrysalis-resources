variables you have to fill:
	<datadir>: The directory your ethereum Instance is situated at
	<port>: the port number under which the Chain should be responding. Our default was "8085"

### starting a network node ###
# open powershell
geth --http --http.port <port> --datadir <datadir> --networkid 123 --nodiscover --http.corsdomain *
# leave this window open
# open new powershell window for the miner
geth attach \\.\pipe\geth.ipc
# this URL should be the same as the one output somewhere as "IPC endpoint" in the first window
# you're now in the JS shell
# x is the number of threads to mine with, 1 works fine, higher numbers are faster but more resource-intensive.
miner.start(x) 
# leave window open

# to stop:
miner.stop()
# then just exit everything
